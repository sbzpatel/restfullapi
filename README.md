Here we are going to create different APIs of methods like POST, GET, PUT(PATCH) & DELETE using technologies like NodeJs(ExpressJs), Javascript, MongoDB, Mongoose etc. Also used third party API for schema validation to enter the proper and required data in the mongoDB database named "Student". 
Also used ExpressJS(NodeJs Framework) to write routes and "mongoose" used to entry with mongoDB database very flawlessly and conviniently.
